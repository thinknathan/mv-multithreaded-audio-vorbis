# mv-multithreaded-audio
 RPG Maker MV Plugin that uses web workers to stream Opus audio.

## Is this ready for production?
NO! This is a hacked-together proof-of-concept. It is lacking the features of a mature audio system. There's no way to seek to different parts of a song, or even to adjust the volume.
